    <h3>Who am I?</h3>

    <cite align="justify">
      Lorenzo is a Software Engineer at Formidable UK ‚Äî a few years ago he
      decided to use React Native for a project. He hasn‚Äôt stopped since: he
      became an Open Source maintainer for the core project, helping the
      Facebook team. He also cares a lot about mental health, so he decided to
      help his local OSS community with a dedicated meetup, ProvidedAsIs.

    - my current speaker description.

    <h3>Things I do</h3>

    <p>
      I mostly write code for a living, and I tend to really love open source.
      So it shouldn't be a surprise you can find me on
      <a href="https://github.com/Kelset">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes - but I've mostly stopped - I write articles and blogposts. You
      can find some examples over at
      <a href="https://medium.com/@Kelset">Medium</a>
      and
      <a href="https://dev.to/kelset">Dev.To</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>I also speak at things, you know?</h3>

    <div>
      Over the last few years I've spoken to multiple events - all around the
      world and even a few remote ones. And a few podcasts too!
    </div>

    <p>
      I'm available for any of these
      <i
        >[Keynotes, Talks, Panels, Moderation, Podcasts, Q&A, Posts, Video
        series]</i
      >
      on the topics of React Native, being a Software Engineer, dealing with
      Mental Health and Open Source (and any intersection of these).
    </p>
