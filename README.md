## See? I'm a cool kid, I have a personal website!

Honestly, I'm really bad at this. Feel free to ignore this website and this repo completely.

### How to use

- do `yarn` and make sure latest version of everything is installed
- use `yarn dev` to check that the changes work locally at http://localhost:3000
- do a `yarn build` to verify that everything works properly
- push it all up the standard way

_(This is actually just for me because I forget how to even use this stuff)_

#### Gotchas:

Since we use Next.js we can NOT use eslint@8. See [this comment's issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/29770#issuecomment-941117297) for more details.
