## See? I'm a cool kid, I have a personal website!

Honestly, I'm really bad at this. Feel free to ignore this website and this repo completely.

### History

- created repo, published via GitHubPages ⛴
- I've finally decided to get a domain. I've used NameCheap & Netlify 👨‍🍳👌
- finally moved away from pure HTML5 to NextJs & Typescript

### How to use

- do `yarn` and make sure latest version of everything is installed
- use `yarn dev` to check that the changes work locally at http://localhost:3000
- push it all up the standard way

_(This is actually just for me because I forget how to even use this stuff)_
