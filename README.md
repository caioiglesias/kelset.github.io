## This is the repo of the ugliest website alive

Please ignore this repo until I actually want to start using Gatsby or something similar and proper domain etc.

Maybe that will never happen. I'm planning to use pure HTML5 for now.

### History

- created repo, published via GitHubPages ⛴
- I've finally decided to get a domain. I've used NameCheap & Netlify 👨‍🍳👌
